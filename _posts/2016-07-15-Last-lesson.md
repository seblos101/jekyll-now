Last lesson!!!

Today was the last I.T lesson in Year 7. Everyone was very sad as we might never be taught by Mr Keen ever again! Anyway, we looked at common propaganda techniques and how we can identify them. Basically every organization is trying to sell something to you with the help of propaganda.

I don't know when I will post again but I hope it will be soon……..but I need a very very VERY long break off school.

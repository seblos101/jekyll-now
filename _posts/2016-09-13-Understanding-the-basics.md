    <td>I learned by trial and error once again as this led me to the correct solution as when things went wrong, for example the HDMI not being plugged into the correct place I took it out and used trial and error to find the correct plug for the correct HDMI socket.

    <td>I think I need to work on being able to cope with challenge and to move on or to try again when necessary as this will lead me to understand the task in hand and it will let me build on it in the future.

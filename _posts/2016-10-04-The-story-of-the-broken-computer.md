    <td>Most of the lesson was actually taken up by instructions which is very unusual. However, there was an even more annoying problem… the computer was just … broken! 
However, I pulled through and fixed it by realising that the HDMI cable and the power cable were mixed up and I swapped them which revived the computer.</td>

    <td>There was only about 10 minutes worth of work to do so I tried to get through as much as possible within this limited time frame. I think I rushed because I didn't save my work as I went along so when I went to transfer my work onto my USB stick all my work was lost!!!!</td>

    <td>I think this time I will definitely save my work as I go along as this will be extremely, excruciatingly annoying if I get a lot of work done. Also I have decided to try to make something better about my website because I must be becoming a bit boring for all my readers so this week I am going to change the corners of my work into curved corners.</td>

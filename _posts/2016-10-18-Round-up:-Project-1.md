(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes as I made a very cool programme that involved guessing a number that was very close to the end of the project.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned by now asking other people when I get stuck because you don't learn when you just copy from someone else. This helped me learn because I know what to do next time I am in that same problem or difficulty. It actually takes a long time to do a piece of code so if you need to do to bits of code then my advice is to make a dent in one and then try and tackle the other.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I don't think anything limited my learning because I was fully focused and I achieved a lot in this lesson. The only thing that I could have changed was out of my control. My partner was trying to get his blog fixed so he couldn't read the code out to me. This was very time wasting. I mentioned this because the only thing that my partner achieved in that lesson was sadness from a deleted blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think the only difference will be the workload that I get through. This is because my partner can read the code out to me and I can read it out to him so we get through a bigger amount of work.</td>

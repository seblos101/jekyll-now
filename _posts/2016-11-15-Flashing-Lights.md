    <td>I leaned by changing the code and put my own little twist on it to make it more challenging and more fun and more entertaining. This makes me want to do it more because it is a lot more fun to work with.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that being scared of taking risks limited my learning because you never if it is wrong until you have tried it and failed it. In my case it was actually logical because I was dealing with metal and electricity which made me scared of electrocuting myself!</td>

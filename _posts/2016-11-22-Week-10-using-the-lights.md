  <tr>
    <td>I learned by, as boring as this may seem, literally just testing each different socket out and then recording which ones had potent ion all of winning and then just combined all of them so it finally worked. We ended up figuring out that the resistor was a way of connecting the flow of the circuits to both sides and we used this to our advantage.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that trying to use the same wires resistors and bulbs hindered my learning because some of them were faulty and if we realised that earlier then we would have achieved the lights turning on much much quicker.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think that I will try to change the wires bulbs and resistors more regularly because that can help our learning. This will improve my learning because I would have finished the task in hand earlier and achieve more in the same amount of time.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make several lights turn on.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes and I passed this challenge and I nearly made I light sensor work depending on how much light can get to the sensor.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by realising that the pinmode (...) was relating to which socket I needed to put the LEDs in and resistors and wires in. This helped me because it allowed to move on and to get more done in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that not realising that the pinmode related to which socket the components needed to go in, early on, hindered my learning because I could have done more in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think about what the codes actually means so I will realise things like the pinmode relating to the socket and that will improve my learning by getting more down in the lesson and that will help me because the lessons are much more useful and effective.</td>

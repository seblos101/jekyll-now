Title: Codecademy.                                             Date: 18/01/17

This week we found a new learn-to-code website to yep is understand the concept of a new programming language: Python.

Code ads have is a very good site and it helped me through the lesson and it has multiple programming languages to choose from including: Git, JavaScript and CSS.

I recommend this site to all of my readers(if there are any) and I will put a link to their website at the bottom of this blog.

Codecademy is good because there are lots of small lessons in a lot of helpful chapters and it sets it out exactly as the language you are programming would e.g. The error message and the colours for correct and incorrect code.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this blog and here is the link to the Codecademy as promised.

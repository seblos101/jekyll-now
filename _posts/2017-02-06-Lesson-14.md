Title: Second lesson of Codecademy     Date: 06/02/17

This weeks lesson was better as i think i achieved more in the lesson. However, even though I achieved 9% in last weeks lesson and I only achieved 5% in this weeks lesson, I still think i achieved more because I completed the exercise I was stuck on and I got through some very difficult exercises. Codecademy are a great learning website and it has about 20 different languages to choose from! Next week's lesson I am looking forward to because I think we are doing a full hour of Codecademy which means I can get a lot of work done!!!

I hope that my viewers(if there are any) are using this website because it is an amazing learning tool and the lessons are very challenging but I feel I can complete them with the help and guidance of Codecademy.

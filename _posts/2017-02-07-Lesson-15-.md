Title: Lesson 15.                Date: 7/02/17

Today's weekly lesson was just what I had hoped for; a full hour of codecademy! This gave me chance to catch-up on the loss of progress that happened when I was stuck on an exercise on the 9% mark. But guess what? I am now on 19%!!!

I feel that I worked very hard in the last few lessons to make up for the loss of progress on 9%. I feel that I worked very efficiently because I had a motive; to gain back the work that I lost on 9%.

Also if any of my viewers have been impressed by my new blog homepage and want to know how to do it I will tell you now:

1. Search "gifs" on the internet and click on images.

2. Select the paint he you want by clicking on it and then click again on view image.

3. Copy the image address and paste it onto line 21 of the style.scss file

4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click commit changes.

5. In a few minutes your changes would have been seen and committed directly to your master branch.

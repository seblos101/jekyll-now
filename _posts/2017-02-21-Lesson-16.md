Title: Lesson 16.                  Date: 21/02/17

Today was another fun lesson of codecademy!! The hour was full of learning and achievement and even though the website said  I achieved 0% I feel I achieved a lot because the percentage tally goes up at a 5% wave at a time and I feel I got to the very end of that wave and I gained tactics to save time in the future. I still feel like Codecademy is an amazing website and a learning tool and I feel like my viewers need more help getting on to the website so I took screenshots and made a step by step guide into how to get to the website:

Title: Lesson 16   Date: 28/2/17

Today's weekly lesson was another action-packed codecademy lesson. We were allowed to do it for the whole hour and I once again achieved a lot of things!

I have been stuck on an exercise that has troubled for the last couple of lessons. I was able to achieve his by re-reading the instructions, hints and texts. The main problem was the colons in the wrong place and lots of other little typos. I am now on to the 23 percent mark and for hw I have to get to 28 percent! Feel that the next chapter of codecademy is very easy so I think I can fly through the next couple of exercises.

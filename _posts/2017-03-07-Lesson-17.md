	**Lesson 17**

Today was  another fun It lesson with codecademy. This weeks lesson was not as fun because we had a cover teacher instead of mr keen but nonetheless we still had a great lesson. Today I achieved by far the most amount of progress than ever befo I somehow managed to achieve 10% progress! 10%! I don't know how i did it but i think it was because i made a target and that was 3%! My target was to achieve 3% progress and I achieved 10%! However there were some negatives as well. T he start my friend's computer wasn't working so i had to try really hard, with my partner, Eshen, to fix his computer. The provoked was with the plug not being plugged into the socket so the whole computer wouldn't turn on. It was relatively easy to fix but the real challenge was to catch up with everyone else after we had lost time to help our friend.

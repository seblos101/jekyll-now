    <td>I learned by reading the instructions carefully and the background text before the exercise abut the exercise itself, as well. This was effective because it helped me complete an exercise that I wasn't really sure what to do on.</td>

    <td>Mr Keen went round the classroom during the lesson today, to see the state that our blogs are in. he said that he liked my background gif but he thought that the colour scheme needed to change because the background looked too much like my font colour. </td>

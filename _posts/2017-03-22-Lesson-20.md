    <td>I learned by looking over some previous exercises on codecademy if I forgot what to do because the languages are very similar. The only difference is that when you print something you need to put brackets and speech marks around what you want to print and you need to type print beforehand.</td>

    <td>I had to leave 10 minutes early because I had a hockey match so I didn't have was much time to master the languages as everyone else in my class did. It would have been worth it if we had won the game but ended up losing to Claire's court by 3 goals!</td>

    <td>I learned by listening to what mr Keen was saying and then trying to understand it before I write it down on my computer. Also, the board is at the front of the room so it is a good tactic to get to the front of the room so you can see what is on the board because it is sometimes hard to see if you are at the side of the room.</td>

**Encoding and decoding:**

The return of the exciting blog is here. I am now in Year 9 and doing some more fun IT. Today's lesson was all about coding and decoding. We had to write a message and then encrypt and then send it an email to someone. This could actually he,pour online security because if someone hacks into our emails - and we have encrypted them - then they won't bother trying to read them.

At first it was hard because it couldn't quite get my head around using the "vlookup".

The "vlookup" is the event that makes the computer encode the message. But I persevered and I eventually understood it.

That is all i have for this week.

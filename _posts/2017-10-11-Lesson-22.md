**Blog for lesson 22**

Today we weren't necessarily given a specific task to do but we were told to do a blog and to significantly improve our website and to give our websites and blogs more colour and to give it our  little twist.

The way that I am significantly improving my channel is that I am adding a gif instead of a boring picture as my background of the blog. I did this by finding a gif that I liked on the internet and then ic copied and pasted the link of the gif onto the style.scss file.

Next week I will be improving the font which i use because I want to make my blogs as creative and as nice to read as possible.

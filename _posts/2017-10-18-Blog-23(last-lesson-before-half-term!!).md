**Blog 23**

**(last lesson before half-term!!!)**

Today was sadly the last week before half-term. And that means no blogs for two weeks!!!!

I don't know how my readers will cope without a blog from me for 2 whole weeks. Anyway, in today's lesson we looked at embedding a youtube link into a blog and then later on in the lesson. We finished the coding and decoding pages and then went on to look at concatenating and splitting messages. We hope that we will have Mr. Tansley as our teacher next year because i think that he is a very good teacher and he is very good at explaining hard concepts.

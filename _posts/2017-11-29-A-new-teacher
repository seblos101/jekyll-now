**Blog 25**

This week was the first IT lesson in year 9 where we didn't have Mr Tansley. It is the return if mr keen!!! I am looking forward to more fun lessons with him. However the only downside is that he gives more homework than mr tansley does!

This weeks homework is to create 3 different programs that make a conversation with the reader.

**Blog 24**

Today we had another fun IT lesson with Mr Keen! Today's lesson was all about the range of numbers in computers. For example, if you type into the computer that you went the computer to to count from 1-10, to reach the next level, it will only count from 1-9 since the computer only deals with whole numbers (integers). For homework, we have to create a repl.it piece of code using help from a document [on our school website.](http://www.challoners.com/) 

Thank you for reading, I will post another blog next week.

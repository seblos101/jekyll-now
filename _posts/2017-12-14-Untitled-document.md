**Blog 25**

Today we had another fun IT lesson with Mr Keen. we looked at online chat-bots, such as boibot and eviebot and wondered what makes them so awful. The conclusion we cam to is that they look for only specific words to answer back, rather than answering your exact question. 

We are making our own programs on [a website called repl.it](https://repl.it/). It is a very good tool that lets you select a variety of coding languages. It is an excellent start for any young coders.

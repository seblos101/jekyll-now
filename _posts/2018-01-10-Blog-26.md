**Blog 26**

In today's IT lesson we learned how to embed our repl.it projects into our blogs (my repl.it will be embedded in this blog) by clicking share and then it showed us the embed url that bwe edit into the blog after the blog is already posted. 

We also learnt that some things that are believed to be completely random are actually not random. For example, when shuffle play songs on spotify we think it is random because there are never two neighbouring songs in an album  played after each other. But if it is truly random then there could be two similar songs played after each other because there is an equal chance that that will be played to a completely different song being played. 

This is because the creators of the 'random' generators actually form them mathematically by creating gaps in the songs so it is seen as random.

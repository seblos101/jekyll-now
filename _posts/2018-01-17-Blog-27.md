Blog 27

In today's IT lesson we were making our own buzzfeed quiz. We did this by asking the first question and then creating a second question based on the first. As always I will embed my work into the blog. If you want to learn how to do this yourself then you click share on the repl.it and then copy and paste the link onto the editing page on the github site.

**Second last lesson of the year!!!**

This week's lesson was sadly second last lesson of the year. Hopefully i have him as a teacher next year or i will be very upset. In this lesson we had karun kicking my chair and then Mr Keen questioned his sexuality! We looked at internet safety and looked at how microchips are actually made. This involves a clean room that is 1000x cleaner then an average room!!!
